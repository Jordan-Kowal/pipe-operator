# Pipe Operator

Elixir's pipe operator in Python

- Callable with any number of args >= 1 (Func, Lambda, Class)
- With or without parenthesis if 1 arg
- tap "side-effect" utils
- No `then` because this is basically a lambda call
- Decorator
  - works on func, method, or even class
  - Does not propagate

# TODO

## Global

- Replace custom workflow with `dependabot` when `uv` gets supported
- Official documentation (generated)

## Python implementation

- Add pipe support for Multiprocessing?

- Add tests for `then`
- Update tests with all use-cases
- Add complex test with and without debug
- Fix typing with PipeStart and other type ignore comments
  - Review .keep() and .update()
- Retry with `__new__` and correct typing, without factory
  - If it works, try to include Then into PipeFactory
